**KuiBaDB** is a research project just to experiment with some ideas:

-   a transaction model inspired by Spanner.
-   a column store and vectorization compute engine inspired by [Hologres: A Cloud-Native Service for Hybrid Serving/Analytical Processing](https://www.aliyun.com/product/bigdata/hologram), [OceanBase](https://github.com/OceanBase/OceanBase) and PostgreSQL.
-   a Kubernetes native distributed OLAP database inspired by [CockroachDB: How we built a forever-free serverless SQL database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/how-we-built-cockroachdb-serverless/).

# Roadmap

-   [x] A prototype has been implemented in [5fc47715](https://github.com/KuiBaDB/KuiBaDB/tree/5fc477152f15573b437c0e82b77c18d292758894).
